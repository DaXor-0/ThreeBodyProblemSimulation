#Three Body Problem
It's a fun little toy simulation of the famous [three-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem) (tbh it's an n-body problem, but the name did't sound so good, soo...)

##Why
This repo was born during a small Hackaton organized by Epicure and Cineca to work on parallel programming.

Us, the developers, took the chance to build a  (totally unaccurate) simulation of this physic problem while trying to parallelize it and analyzing its performances and scalability.

##Now
Porting it to CUDA and testing the code on different machine (fun time).

You're more than welcome to fork this repo and do your own experiments with it.
